<code>
# Main portion of the class
while loop:
    cost, payment = ask_value()
    change = payment - cost
    while change < 0:
        print("You need to pay more than what is owed, try again.")
        cost, payment = ask_value()
        change = payment - cost

    change_print = change
    change = change * 100

    # Calculations for the numbers of each coin, changing the value of change after each calculation
    quarters = coin_calc(25, change)
    change = change - quarters * 25
    dimes = coin_calc(10, change)
    change = change - dimes * 10
    nickels = coin_calc(5, change)
    change = change - nickels * 5
    pennies = coin_calc(1, change)
