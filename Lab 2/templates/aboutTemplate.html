        My name is Brian Harshaw, and I was born on the 29th of April in the year 2000, at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.
        I grew up in Simsbury, Connecticut for my whole life, where I graduated from Simsbury High School with high honors and
        moved on to Marist. I am currently a sophmore at Marist majoring in computer science while exploring all different fields
        related to computers. I enjoy learning about technology and playing video games, both of which cycle my sleep schedule
        towards being nocturnal. Currently I enjoy playing Borderlands 3 in my free time.
